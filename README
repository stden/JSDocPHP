JSDocPHP v0.9

Thank you using JSDocPHP. This script creates a set of
HTML-based API docs for your JavaScript files. You can
parse one JS file or multiple files from within a folder.
Simply issue the following command:

'php jsdoc.php myjavascript.js'

OR

'php jsdoc.php myjavascriptfolder'

It will create the API docs in a folder called 'docs'.
Optionally, you can pass an output folder to it as well:

'php jsdoc.php myjavascriptfolder mydocs'

Within your JavaScript code, you can simply use standard
PHP-style docblocks with the usual tags (@param, @return,
etc.) to comment above your prototypes, functions and
methods. For an example, view the included EXAMPLE.TXT file.
